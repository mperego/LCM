\class Interface

\brief <b> A class to construct a single interface </b>

This class is used to construct a single conforming or non-conforming
interface.  The interface is constructed by creating an empty instance of this
class and then filling it with nodes and segments from both sides of the
interface using the methods \ref AddSegment (MOERTEL::Segment &seg, int side)
and \ref AddNode (MOERTEL::Node &node, int side).<br> After all segment and all
nodes of an interface are added, a call to \ref Complete() finalizes the
construction phase of the interface.<br> Once the interface is constructed and
\ref Complete() was called, it should be passed to an instance of the \ref
MoertelT::Manager to handle the integration phase. It is highly recommended not
to call any integration methods on the interface directly but leave this task
to the \ref MoertelT::Manager class that takes care of assembly of integration
results and the case were nodes appear on more then one interface.<br>

<b>Aspects of Interface geometry:</b><br>
An interface can be either 2-dimensional (for 3D problems) or 1-dimensional (for
2D problems).<br> It can also be curved in space or straight. In the latter
case, the Mortar method guarantees the patch test for linear functions in 3D and
2D problems.<br> With curved interfaces, the patch test is not guaranteed but
approximation properties tend to be significantly better then with simple
node-to-segment (or similar) approaches.<br> The two sides of an interface need
not have conforming discretizations, need not discretize the same geometry and
might overlap only partially. This means one side of an interface might be
significantly larger then the other side. Also, end points of an interface side
need not match.<br> <br> 1D Example (also holds for 2D interfaces): <pre>

           o----------o----------o----------o----------o--------------o side 0
o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o------o------o
side 1

</pre>
In the 1D interface case, end points of an interface are detected automatically
while in the 2D interface case, the user has to supply information which nodes
fall on the boundary of an interface.<br>

In the case of more then one interface, each interface must have 2 distinct
sides. <br> Also, each interface side must not overlap with any other interface
side. <br> 1D Example (also holds for 2D interfaces): <pre>
                                                        ||
                                                        ||
                                                        |o
                                                        ||
                                Interface 3, side 1 --> o| <-- Interface 3, side
0
                                                        ||
                                                        |o
                                                        o|
                                                        ||
                                                        |o
                                                        o|
                                                        ||
            <-- Interface 1, side 0  -->                ||<-- Interface 2, side
1 -->
    o------o----------o----------o----------o-----------oo--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o--o
o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o------o------o-----o-----o
                                             <-- Interface 1 side 1 -->
                                             <-- Interface 2 side 0 -->
</pre>
The example above shows a perfectly legal (though rather advanced an unusual)
case.<br> The choice of the sides 0 or 1 is arbitrary, the correct choice of the
slave and mortar side is sophisticated here and can be done by the \ref
MoertelT::Manager or by the user himself.

<br>
<b>Comments on parallelism:</b><br>
The Moertel package can handle multiple interfaces in serial and in parallel.
When running in serial, the Mortar package expects the Teuchos_Comm argument in
the construction of \rer MoertelT::Manager and \ref MoertelT::Interface to
implement an Teuchos_SerialComm. <br> When running in parallel the MOERTEL
package epxects this Teuchos-Comm to implement Teuchos_MPIComm. In the parallel
case the package mainly makes use of the communication methods of the
Teuchos_MPIComm but also performs direct MPI calls using the MPI communicator
extracted from the Teuchos_MPIComm.<br> Passing nodes and segments via \ref
AddNode and \ref AddSegment to an Interface instance implicitly defines the
processes ownership over those objects. Calls to these methods therefore are
never collective! Passing a node or segment object to an Interface also results
in the process taking part in the integration of this Interface. the call to
\ref Complete() will create a interface-local Teuchos_MPIComm or
Teuchos_SerialComm as subset of the global Teuchos_comm supplied by the user.
All processes that passed segments or nodes to the interface will become member
of that interface-local communicator. Processes not passing any data to the
interface will not participate in the integration of that specific interface and
the integration will be non-blocking to them.<br> Note that when defining
several interfaces, the interface-local communicators might be overlapping
subsets of the global communicator.<br> <br> Example 1: Running on 6
processes<br> Process 0 has objects on interface 1 and 2<br> Process 1 has
objects on interface 1 <br> Process 2 has objects on interface 2 <br> Process 3
has objects on interface 2 <br> Process 4 has objects on interface 1 <br>
Process 5 has no objects on any interface<br>
Result:<br>
Processes 0,1,4 share integration on interface 1<br>
Processes 2,3 share integration on interface 2<br>
Process 5 is not blocked by the MOERTEL package<br>
<b>Interfaces 1,2 are computed completely in parallel as interface subsets are
non-overlapping</b><br> <br> Example 1: Running on 4 processes<br> Process 0 has
objects on interface 1 and 2<br> Process 1 has objects on interface 1 <br>
Process 2 has objects on interface 2 <br>
Process 3 has no objects on any interface<br>
Result:<br>
Processes 0,1 share integration on interface 1 <br>
Process 2 does integration on interface 2 alone<br>
Process 3 is not blocked by the MOERTEL package<br>
<b>Interfaces 1,2 are computed in serial as interface subsets are
overlapping</b><br>

All calls to the \ref Interface(int Id, bool oneD, Teuchos_Comm& comm, int
outlevel) constructor are collective for all processes that are part of the
Teuchos_Comm comm.<br> The computation phase though will not be collective as
computations are only shared among those processes that have ownership of a node
or a segment on this interface. That is process that passed in a segment or a
node to this interface and therefore become a member of the internally
constructed interface-local Teuchos_Comm \ref lComm().<br> The computation is
non-blocking for all other processes. This allows the parallel computation of
several interfaces at the same time.<br> This approach assumes that the user
will balance the underlying domain among processes but will not try to balance
the layout of the interfaces. It can therefore be expected that interfaces will
not be load balanced. Therefore, a single interface can be shared among an
arbitrary subset of all processes in any geometrical configuration. It is though
computationally advantageous when as few as possible processes work on a single
interface and non-overlapping subsets of processes work on different interfaces
at the same time.

  manually. This is done by attaching one or two \ref MOERTEL::Function derived
  classes to the segments.

  The \ref MoertelT::Interface class does not take ownership of func and the
  instance func can be destroyed directly after a call to this method

  \param side : Side of the interface (0 or 1) the function is to be attached to
  \param id : Function id. The trace space shape function has to have id=0,
              the mortar space shape function has to have id=1.
              Therefore, on the mortar side, only one function with id=0 is
  necessary while on the slave side (where the Lagrange multipliers 'live') 2
  functions with id=0 and id=1 are necessary. \param func : \ref
  MOERTEL::Function derived function class to be associated with the shape
  functions of the trace or the mortar space

  For future extension of this package, any number of functions can be
  associated with one segment as long as each function has a unique positive
  id.<br> Currently the package makes use of functions with ids 0 (trace space)
  and 1 (mortar space)

  \warning In case the Mortar side is unknown to the user as he wishes to leave
  the choice of the Mortar side to the \ref MoertelT::Manager, he can not set
  the mortar space shape functions to the slave side (as the slave side is
  unknown). In this case \ref SetFunctionTypes(MOERTEL::Function::FunctionType
  primal, MOERTEL::Function::FunctionType dual) should be used to specify the
  types of shape functions on wishes to use. The \ref MoertelT::Manager will
  then associate the appropriate shape functions with the segments on the
  appropriate sides once the mortar side was chosen. This though only works when
  derived function classes and types are used that are known to the \ref
  MoertelT::Manager. If the user want to create his/her own shae functions and
  use them, he/she needs to set them manually using this method.

  of the interface but leaves the choice to the \ref MoertelT::Manager class
